Brave Puffin is adrift. The boat is 700 km (435 mi) from the launch point - as the crow flies. Path wise, Puffin traveled 880 miles in two months, while zig zagging on one motor. It appears the boat is now just drifting, i.e. the left motor is out too.

Yet, Brave Puffin is communicating - which means the main enclosure has no leaks, and the solar panel + battery are OK. That is after surviving a few medium strength storms, and being in the water for a while. Heck, if things keep going like that, the boat will soon cross the start line (in green):

Of course the mission is now a failed attempt. We hope to recover the boat one day, but currently it's out of reach.
