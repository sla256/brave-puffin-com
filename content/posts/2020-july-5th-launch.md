And, Brave Puffin is on its way, attempting to [finish The Microtransat Challengee 2020](https://www.microtransat.org/2020_brave_puffin_boat.php)! With lots of good wishes...

We launched it from Marconi Beach on Cape Cod around 2:40 pm Eastern time, in a bit of a surf.

The boat is programmed to reach its target point (51ºN 16ºW) on the finish line, which will take a few months and 2,500 km if all goes well.

That's not all: as a stretch goal, Brave Puffin will then automatically turn back to come home, crossing the ocean again. If successful, the full roundtrip will require it to travel well over 5,000 km, and will take many months.
